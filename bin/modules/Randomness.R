    ## is a non-parametric statistical test that checks a randomness hypothesis for a two-valued data sequence. 
    ## More precisely, it can be used to test the hypothesis that the elements of the sequence are mutually independent.

    ## as a series of similar responses.

    #   - statistic: the value of the normalized statistic test.
    #   - parameter: a vector with the sample size, and the values of n1 and n2.
    #   - p.value: the p-value of the test.
    #   - alternative: a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.
    #   - method: a character string indicating the test performed.
    #   - data.name: a character string giving the name of the data.
    #   - runs: the total number of runs (not shown on screen).
    #   - mu: the mean value of the statistic test (not shown on screen).
    #   - var: the variance of the statistic test (not shown on screen).
